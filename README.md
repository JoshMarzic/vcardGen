# vcardGen
Vcard / contact list generator

TO USE: 

  Save a .CSV file called "ContactCSV.csv" in the same location the script is located. 

  Make sure the ContactCSV.csv is formatted as follows: 

  firstName,lastName,Title,Location(2 letter code, translated later, hard coded in),phone#,extension,email 

  Edit the Location(s) as needed. 
  
  Then change the .txt output to .vcf and tadah! You have your vcard. 


I doubt anyone will use this, but just wanted to throw it up here! Good luck! 

Possible future changes: 
  make input / output per 1 contact, for better performance with a larger contact list
  Make an input section that asks what fields you'd like to use(incase only Fname, Lname, and # are the only important bits of data)
  Make an input / editing section for location so it doesn't have to be hard-coded.
